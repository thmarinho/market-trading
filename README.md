## Python > c++
```
We chose Python for several reasons: it's an easy-to-use language, and also a laguage made for mathematics.
In locurence this project is largely made up of mathematics.
Since the project includes an important part of algorythmics and Python has a large choice of data processing libraries, we chose this language instead of C++.
